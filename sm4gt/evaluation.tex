\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Old Benchmarks, reproduced}

\subsection{Atomized Benchmarks}

\subsection{New Results}
Study rmacs, dr bayes, and others.

Share two things:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  How bad were these?
  Is sound gradual typing dead for large projects?
\item
  How hard were these to run?
  What was the porting / experimental strategy?
  Can we avoid making two copies (typed/untyped) of each benchmark?
\end{itemize}
