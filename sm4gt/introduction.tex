\section{Introduction}

Our performance evaluation does not scale.
It's too much to build and run.
We suggest tools to extrapolate with statistics.

Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  (Maybe) identify new parameter of interest.
\item
  Design an experiment for approximating performance with statistics.
  Discuss design choices, tradeoffs, and the true meaning of each statistic.
\item
  Run our experiment on life-size programs.
\end{itemize}
