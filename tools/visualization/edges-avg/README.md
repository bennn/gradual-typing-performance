edges-avg
=========

Module graphs showing the average runtime of configurations where
each edge is a boundary.

- Each node is a file in the project

- Edges are labeled with the average runtime of configurations where
  this edge is a boundary (typed/untyped OR untyped/typed)

- Edge widths are in proportion to the number of times greater
  the label runtime is compared to the minimum runtime.
