We need to work out a working hypothesis and two parameters need to be
thought about: 

1. the amount of work it takes to get out of a 'hot spot' 
   
   current working idea: * system plus 'amount' of type annotation 


2. the badness of performance degradation. 
   
   current working idea: possibly dependent on program and its context
