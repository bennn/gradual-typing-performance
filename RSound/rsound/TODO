- get rid of internal FFT code copied from Doug Williams, use racket/math instead.

- add docs for resample, resample/interpolate, probably others.

- wow, GC time is *terrible* for piano example, resampling 3-second sound linearly. Might
  be better in TR.

- why is startup time (require rsound) so terrible?
