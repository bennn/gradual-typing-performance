Meeting notes
-------------

2015-08-28 (all NU authors present)
-----------------------------------
  * Discussed new contract profiling results on worst case variations
  * Got interesting numbers on % runtime in contracts, % contract runtime
    in predicate contracts, library contracts, & HOF contracts

  Unresolved questions on numbers
  * MBTA numbers are zero, need to run longer
  * What is the % of "misc" other contracts made up of
  * What is the profiler measuring in the predicate cases?
    (probably the (-> any/c boolean?) contract and not the
     actual predicate--surprising that that is slow)

  Goals for next meeting
  * "Verify" contract overhead numbers by removing select contracts and
    checking runtime.
  * See contract profiler accuracy. Also see if Racket HEAD improves it.
  * What's going on with profiling for, e.g., (listof ...) contracts?
  * Footnotes in paper about limitations/problems that ruled out some
    potential projects
