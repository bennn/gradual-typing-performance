How to use the patches in this folder
-------------------------------------

The patches
  0001-Add-a-typed-racket-unsafe-library.patch
  0002-Add-docs-for-unsafe-TR-operations.patch

implement unsafe provide/require operations, backported to Racket v6.2.

To use the patches, unpack Racket v6.2 source code into

  racket-6.2/

and then do the following:

  cd racket-6.2/share/pkgs
  patch -p1 < 0001-Add-a-typed-racket-unsafe-library.patch
  patch -p1 < 0002-Add-docs-for-unsafe-TR-operations.patch

(replace the patch paths with wherever they are in the filesystem)



After installing, the file `./test/main.rkt` in this directory should compile.
