The purpose of this repo is to share work among the team members that study
the performance hypothesis underlying gradual typing.

Auxillary folders:
- `thoughts/` our first folder, for gathering ideas
- `tools/` scripts for creating, running, and visualizing the lattice
- `threads/` experiments debugging MBTA
