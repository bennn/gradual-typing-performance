The purpose of this repo is to share work among the team members that study
the performance hypothesis underlying gradual typing.

Auxillary folders:
- `micro/` simulated micro gradual typing benchmarks
- `thoughts/` our first folder, for gathering ideas
- `tools/` scripts for creating, running, and visualizing the lattice
- `threads/` experiments debugging MBTA
- `paper/` contains the main performance evaluation paper
- `stop-2015` our STOP 2015 position paper
- `artifact` scripts for building our POPL16 artifact

See "how-to-setup.md" in this repo for how to structure a project.
