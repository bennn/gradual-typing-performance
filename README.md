[under construction] gradual-typing-performance
===

The purpose of this repo is to share work among the team members that study
the performance hypothesis underlying gradual typing.


Overview
---
We have a few scripts in the project root, but most of the content is in a subfolder:
- `benchmarks`     : root folder for typed/untyped programs, the rolling suite of motivation
- `data`           : collected datasets
- `experimental`   : micro-benchmarks & unproven ideas
- `paper`          : writings on gradual typing performance
- `pre-benchmark`  : programs that are not yet ready to run
- `post-benchmark` : obselete benchmarks
- `tools`          : scripts for understanding results & avoiding performance holes


Running experiments
