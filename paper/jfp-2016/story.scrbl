@title[#:tag "sec:story"]{Gradual Typing in Typed Racket}

Typed Racket@~cite[tfffgksst-snapl-2017] is a sound gradual typing system for Racket.
Typed Racket's syntax is an extension of Racket's, its static type checker supports idioms common in dynamically-typed Racket programs@~cite[thf-popl-2008 stf-esop-2009 tfdffthf-ecoop-2015], and a Typed Racket module may import definitions from a Racket module.
A Racket module may likewise import definitions from a Typed Racket module.
To ensure type soundness@~cite[tfffgksst-snapl-2017], Typed Racket compiles static types to higher-order contracts and applies these contracts at the lexical boundaries between Typed Racket and Racket modules.

@Figure-ref{fig:story:tr} demonstrates gradual typing in Typed Racket with a small application.
The dynamically-typed module on the top left implements a guessing game with the function @racket[play].
Each call to @racket[play] generates a random number and returns a function that checks a given number against this chosen number.
The Racket module on the top right implements a @exact|{{na\"ive}}| player.
The driver module at the bottom combines the game and player.
It generates a game, prompts @racket[stubborn-player] for ten guesses, and counts the number of correct guesses using the @racket[for/sum] combinator.
Of the three modules, only the driver is implemented in Typed Racket.
This means that Typed Racket statically checks the body of the driver module under the assumption that its annotations for the @racket[play] and @racket[stubborn-player] functions are correct.
Typed Racket protects this assumption by compiling these type annotations into contracts; at runtime, the contracts enforce the types.
For example, one contract checks that @racket[(play)] returns a function from natural numbers to booleans (by applying a new contract to the returned value), and the other checks that @racket[stubborn-player] returns natural numbers.

@section{How Types Spread}

The close integration of Racket and Typed Racket makes gradual typing useful for refactoring existing programs.
By converting a module to Typed Racket, the maintainer receives:
@itemlist[
  @item{
    @emph{assurance} from the typechecker against simple logical errors;
  }
  @item{
    @emph{documentation} in the form of type annotations;
  }
  @item{
    @emph{protection} against dynamically-typed clients; and
  }
  @item{
    @emph{speed}, when the compiler can use types to generate efficient bytecode.
  }
]
These perceived benefits draw Racket programmers to Typed Racket.
When debugging a Racket module, for example, a programmer can add type annotations to enforce invariants within the module.
Typed Racket's runtime checks may then discover issues when the now-typed module interacts with the rest of the codebase.

Another, more subtle, way that Racket programs may rely on Typed Racket is by importing definitions from a typed library.
For example, every program that uses the built-in @racket[plot] library (including the program that generated this paper) interacts with typed code.
This kind of interaction is indistinguishable from importing definitions from a Racket library.

Conversely, Typed Racket programmers may use Racket to work with legacy code, prototype new designs, or write program-manipulating programs.
These are situations where the effort of managing type annotations may outweigh the ease of running the Racket code and checking the result.

In summary, Typed Racket offers an accessible upgrade path from Racket and is currently used in a variety of programs.@note{@url{https://pkgd.racket-lang.org/pkgn/search?q=typed-racket}}
These programs frequently combine Racket and Typed Racket code; over time this combination may shift to a larger proportion of typed code, but Racket will likely remain the core language.
It is therefore essential that Typed Racket programs interact smoothly with existing Racket code.

@section{The Need for Performance Evaluation}

Typed Racket is an evolving research project.
The initial release delivered a sound type system that could express the idioms in simple Racket programs.
Subsequent improvements focused on growing the type system and making it easier to use.
All along, the maintainers of Typed Racket knew that the performance cost of enforcing type soundness could be high (see @secref{sec:devils} for an overview); however, this cost was not an issue in many programs.

As other programmers began using Typed Racket, a few discovered serious issues with its performance.
For instance, one user experienced a 1.5x slowdown in a web server,
 others found 25x--50x slowdowns when using an array library,
 and two others reported over 1000x slowdowns when using a library of functional data structures.@note{The appendix contains a list of user reports.}
These performance issues were unacceptable to users because they were large, difficult to predict, and difficult to debug.
Instead of making a program run more efficiently, adding types to the wrong boundary degraded performance by an order of magnitude.

Programmers' experience with Typed Racket has articulated the need for a systematic performance evaluation to:
 (1) determine the extent of the performance issue;
 (2) identify sources of poor performance;
 (3) help users resolve performance issues; and
 (4) improve the implementation of Typed Racket.
