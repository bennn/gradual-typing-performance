JFP accepts (up to) 10-minute videos with accepted papers.

Lets make a video for this paper.

Current plan (2018-10-22): make slides, do a voice-over.


Outline
---

- Title, authors, history of authors
- Purpose: a method to evaluation the perf. of a gradual typing system
- What does it mean for _typing system_ to have performance?
- Well, GT is about mixing
- Types are claims
- Mixing means claims might be out of sync
- Cost to enforce claims at the boundary
- Anecdotal evidence, can have a BIG impact
- Emails from users
- Method 1: space = lattice
- Method 2: D-deliverable metric
- Method 3: plots (D-deliv => lots of lattices ; lattice => bar ; histogram => lots of samples)
- Summary of method, see paper for application to TR
- THREATS TO VALIDITY
- serious threat, does not scale ... micro gt
- Q. can we approximate the % of D-deliverable configs out of 2^N from O(N) measures?
- yes (for details see cost of type-tag soundness ?)
- imagine a big lattice , fix value for D ... D=4
- pick 1 at random, fill in 1 blank, get a proportion
- at limit, get true proportion
- before then, more is better
- fix S take R samples ... should all be close lets combine
- Protocol: S,R; R-%D's; 95-ci
- instantiate S=10N R=10 apply to big benchmarks get sleeve of truth
- judge for yourself whether the approximations are good, but we conclude
- THREATS again, only works for this %-D-deliv question (but that's all we really care about)
  if you have a different metric that you think a programmer cares about, need to propose a method
  ... we can definitely think of systems-level metrics, but not user-level metrics
- in conclusion: problem, exhaustive, approximate
- in the paper: details, especially the TR application
- keep measuing in future

- special thanks to Sam TH

(introduce self)
3-year team effort

program = collection of modules

type boundary

if we want to have a relation between types and
values, need to check (aka soundness)

if 4 components explore all 2^4 possible
programmer may start at bottom move up to some
 middle point do not know what must do all

communicate to language implementor

miserable

D = worst thing implementor willing to impose,
summarize entire lattice as a %
dont know what D works in practice --- dataset for more
