@title{Is Sound Gradual Typing Dead?}

@abstract{Programmers have come to embrace dynamically-typed languages for
 prototyping and delivering large and complex systems. When it comes to
 maintaining and evolving these systems, the lack of explicit static typing
 becomes a bottleneck. In response, researchers have explored the idea of
 gradually-typed programming languages which allow the post-hoc addition of
 type annotations to software written in one of these untyped languages.
 Some of these new, hybrid languages insert run-time checks at the boundary
 between typed and untyped code to establish type soundness for the overall
 system. With sound gradual typing, programmers can rely on the language
 implementation to provide meaningful error messages when type invariants
 are violated.

 While most of the research on sound gradual typing has remained theoretical, the
 few emerging implementations suffer from performance overheads due to these
 checks. None of the publications on this topic come with a
 comprehensive performance evaluation. However, a few report disastrous numbers.
 In response, this paper proposes a method for
 evaluating the performance of gradually-typed programming languages.
 The method takes the idea
 of a gradual conversion from untyped to typed seriously and calls for
 measuring the performance of all possible partial conversions of a given untyped
 benchmark. The paper reports on the results of applying the method to
 Typed Racket, a mature implementation of sound gradual typing, and a suite
 of real-world programs of various sizes and complexities.  Based on the
 results obtained in this study, the paper concludes that, given the current state
 of implementation technologies, sound gradual typing is
 dead. Conversely, it raises the question of how implementations could 
 reduce the overheads associated with soundness and how
 tools could be used to steer programmers clear from pathological cases.}
