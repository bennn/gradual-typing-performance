@title[#:tag "sec:death"]{Sound Gradual Typing is Dead}

Unsound type systems are useful. They find bugs, and an IDE can use them to
 assist programmers. Sound type systems are meaningful in addition. A
 soundly typed program can't go wrong, up to a well-defined set of run-time
 exceptions@~cite[type-soundness]. When a typed program raises an
 exception, the exception message can (usually) pinpoint the location of
 the problem in the program source. As a result, types are one of the best
 forms of documentation and specification around. In the context of a sound
 type system, the type of a well-named function or method often explains
 (almost) as much as an inspection of their code will do.

From this description, it is clear why programmers eventually wish to
 annotate programs in untyped languages with types and, ideally, with sound
 types. Types increase a programmer's productivity, and sound types greatly
 help with testing, debugging, and other bug-related maintenance tasks.
 Hence sound gradual typing seems to be such a panacea. The problem is,
 however, that the cost of enforcing soundness appears to be overwhelming
 according to our measurements. 

In general, the graphs in @figure-ref["fig:lnm1" "fig:lnm2"] clarify how
 few partially typed configurations are usable by developers or deliverable
 to customers. For almost all benchmarks, the lines are below the (red)
 horizontal line of acceptability. Even with extremely liberal settings for
 @math{N} and @math{M}, few configurations are @math{N}-deliverable or
 @math{N/M}-usable. Worse, investing more effort into type annotation does
 not seem to pay off. In practice, converting a module takes a good portion
 of a workday, meaning that setting @math{L} to @math{2} is again a liberal
 choice. But even allowing the conversion of two additional modules does
 not increase the number of acceptable configurations by much. Put
 differently, the number of @math{L}-step @math{N/M}-acceptable
 configurations remains small with liberal choices for all parameters.

Like Marc Antony, we come here to bury sound gradual typing, not to praise
 it. Sound gradual typing is dead.

@section{Threats to Validity of Conclusion}

Our judgment is harsh and fails to acknowledge three potential weaknesses
 in our evaluation framework and in our results. 

First, our benchmarks are relatively small. The two largest ones consist of
 13 and 16 modules, respectively. Even these benchmarks pose serious
 challenges to our computing infrastructure because they require timing
 @math{2^13} and @math{2^16} configurations @math{30} times each (to rule
 out random effects). Running experiments with modules that consist of many
 more modules would probably prove impossible. At the same time, our
 experience suggests that the results get worse as programs get larger (in
 terms of number of modules). 

Second, many of our benchmarks import some modules from Racket's suite of
 libraries that remain untyped throughout the process, including for the
 fully typed configuration. While some of these run-time libraries come in
 the trusted code base---meaning Typed Racket knows their types and the
 types are not compiled to contracts---others are third-party libraries
 that impose a cost on all configurations. In principle, these interfaces
 might contribute a large fraction of the running-time overhead of the
 partially typed configurations of our benchmarks. Given the highly
 reasonable typed-untyped ratios, we consider the effect of these libraries
 minor. 

Third, our framework images a particularly @emph{free} approach to
 annotating programs with types. With ``free'' we mean that we do not
 expect software engineers to add types to modules in any particular
 order. Although this freedom is representative of some kind of maintenance
 work---add types when bugs are repaired and only then---a team may decide
 to add types to an entire project in a focused approach. In this case,
 they may come up with a particular kind of plan that avoids all of these
 performance traps. Roughly speaking, such a plan would correspond to a
 specific path from the bottom element of the performance lattice to the
 top element.  Sadly our current measurements suggest that almost all
 bottom-to-top paths in our performance lattices suffer from road blocks. 

As the @tt{sieve} and @tt{suffixtree} examples demonstrate, a path-based
 approach depends very much on the structure of the module graph.  We
 therefore conjecture that some of the ideas offered in the conclusion
 section may help such planned, path-based approaches.

Fourth, we state our judgment with respect to the current implementation
 technology. Typed Racket compiles to Racket, which uses rather
 conventional compilation technology. It makes no attempt to reduce the
 overhead of contracts or to exploit contracts for optimizations. It
 remains to be seen whether contract-aware compilers or less-expressive
 gradual typing systems can reduce the significant overhead that our
 evaluation shows.
