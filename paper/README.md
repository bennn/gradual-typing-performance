Draft for POPL 2015.

To compile the paper, run `make`.
This will take approximately 30 minutes the first time, or after running `make clean`,
 because it processes our experimental data to create figures.


Sub-Directories
---------------

- `data/` Experimental results from our benchmarks.
  This data is used to create our figures when the paper is compiled.
- `module-graphs/` Diagrams showing the module structure of our benchmarks.
