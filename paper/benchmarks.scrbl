@title[#:tag "sec:bm"]{The Benchmark Programs}

For our evaluation of Typed Racket, we strove to obtain benchmark
programs that are representative of code that users actually write. To this end,
most of the benchmarks are either based on third-party libraries or scripts sourced
from the original developer or from the Racket package repository.
A single benchmark is taken from an existing microbenchmark suite.

@section{Program descriptions}

This subsection details each of the benchmark programs in our evaluation. Each
description notes the number of modules, the shape of the module structure,
external dependencies of the program, and whether the program needed additional
tweaking to fit into the evaluation framework. The number of modules always
indicates how many modules are included in the lattice---i.e., are either
typed or untyped depending on the configuration. Adaptor
modules---explained below---or additional helper or data files that are always
untyped (or typed) are not included in the count.
@Figure-ref["fig:bm"] lists and summarizes the benchmarks.

Several of the projects need a typed ``adaptor module'' which sits
between a data definition module in the original program and its typed clients.
These adaptors create a uniform typed data definition for all variations in the
lattice. This is crucial since Racket structure types
(record type definitions) are @emph{generative} in the sense that two distinct
definitions of the same structure type will define incompatible structures.

In our experiment, untyped modules directly import definition files and typed
modules always import through an adaptor. Thus we incur a small, unnecessary
overhead when a typed module uses data originally defined in a typed module,
but overall this pattern made it feasible to test all variations with little
change to a project's original design.

@parag{Sieve}
This program finds prime numbers using the Sieve of Erastothones and is our
smallest benchmark. It consists of two modules---a streams library and a
script implementing the Sieve using streams---and has minimal dependencies on
trusted core Racket libraries.

@parag{Echo}
The echo server implements a simple network server/client pair and is a microbenchmark
originally used in the Computer Language Benchmarks Game@note{@url["http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/"]}.
It consists of four modules in a diamond shape in which the client and
server modules both depend on a shared constants module. This program also
only depends on Racket's trusted core libraries.

@parag{Morse code}
The @tt{morse-code} script was adapted from a morse code training program.
Running the script repeatedly generates a random string, translates the string
to morse code, then compares the Levenshtein distance of the original string
with a second random string (simulating user input). The script contains four
modules in a vee shape (two chains of modules from a main module) and has
minimal dependencies.

@parag{MBTA}
The @tt{mbta} program implements a server that asynchronously responds to
reachability queries about a public transit system.
It contains four modules in a single chain but also depends on a third-party
graph library. Since the graph library is untyped, this introduces a typed-untyped
boundary even in the ``completely typed'' case.

@parag{Suffixtree}
The @tt{suffixtree} library implements a longest-common-substring algorithm. The
implementation contains five modules in a single chain. While the library has
minimal external dependencies, we need to add in an adapter module for the
data definition module.

@parag{ZO Traversal}
The @tt{zo-traversal} script explores Racket bytecode structures and consists
of five modules. The module structure is essentially one chain, but for two
independent modules providing the core functionality. The
script operates on the Racket compiler's untyped zo data structures. Since
these data structures are not natively supported in Typed Racket, even the
completely typed program incurs some dynamic overhead from using these structures.

@parag{K-CFA}
The @tt{kfca} program is a small implementation of control flow analysis consisting
of seven modules arranged in one chain. This program requires
four adaptor modules, but is otherwise self-contained.

@parag{Synth}
The @tt{synth} is a sound synthesis example from St-Amour @|etal|'s work on
feature-specific profiling@~cite[saf-cc-2015]. The program consists of nine modules. The original
example uses an array library that we inline into this program
(by extracting modules from the library into the benchmark). As part of the
inlining, we created an adaptor module for the core array data structure.

@parag{Tetris}
This benchmark program is based on a contract verification benchmark
by NguyÃªn @|etal|@~cite[nthvh-icfp-2014]. It implements the eponymous game
and consists of nine modules. An adaptor module wraps the record structure
used to represent the game board. Our benchmark runs a pre-recorded history
of moves altering the game state; it does not include a GUI.

@parag{Snake}
This program is taken from the same benchmark suite as @tt{tetris} and
consists of twelve modules. Like @tt{tetris}, it also
requires one adaptor module and runs a recorded history of game moves.

@parag{Gregor}
This benchmark contains thirteen modules and stress-tests a
date and time library. The original library uses the @racketmodname[racket/generic]
library for ad-hoc polymorphism that is not supported by Typed Racket. We
get around this limitation by monomorphizing the code and removing the library's
string parsing component. The resulting benchmark has minimal dependencies and
uses two adaptor modules.

@parag{Quad}
The @tt{quad} project is an experimental typesetting library consisting
of sixteen modules. It depends on an external constraint satisfaction solver
library (to divide lines of text across multiple columns) and uses two adaptor modules.
