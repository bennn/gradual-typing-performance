@title[#:tag "sec:bm"]{The Benchmark Programs}

For our evaluation of Typed Racket, we use benchmark
programs that are representative of actual user code and
small enough so that the performance lattice remains reasonable.
Most of the benchmarks are either based on third-party libraries or scripts sourced
from the original developer or from the Racket package repository.

@section{Technical Overview}

The table in @figure-ref{fig:bm} lists and summarizes our twelve benchmark programs.
For each, we give an approximate measure of the program's size and a diagram of
its module structure.

Size is measured by the number of modules and lines of code (LOC) in a program.
Crucially, the number of modules also determines the number of gradually-typed
variations we ran when testing the benchmark, as a program with @math{n} modules
can be gradually typed in @math{2^n} possible variations.
Lines of code is less important for evaluating macro gradual typing,
but gives a sense of the overall complexity of each benchmark.
Moreover, the Type Annotations LOC numbers are an upper bound on the annotations required
at any stage of gradual typing because each typed module in our experiment
fully annotates its import statements. In practice, only imports from untyped
modules require annotation.

The column labeled ``Other LOC'' measures the additional structure required to
run each project for all typed-untyped variations. This count includes project-wide
type definitions, typed interfaces to untyped libraries, and any so-called
typed adaptor modules (see below) we needed to add.

Finally, the module structure graphs show a dot for each module in the program
and an arrow from one module to another when the module at the arrow tail
imports definitions from the module at the arrow head.
The performance cost of gradual typing originates at boundaries between typed
and untyped modules, so it is interesting to compare the complexity of these
graphs with our experimental results in section@secref{sec:tr}.
This correlation, however, is a weak one because the module graphs show only
@emph{static} dependencies, whereas the runtime cost of each boundary depends
heavily on the frequency at which values flow across.
@;;; to address this, we TODO added a counter to each contract and ran the prog.


@subsection{Typed Adaptor Modules}

Typed adaptor modules are a special case of typed interfaces to untyped code,
inserted when an untyped data definition and the data's typed clients are
part of the same configuration.
The adaptor is a typed module that exports annotated versions of all
bindings in the untyped data definition.
Typed clients then import exclusively from the typed adaptor, bypassing the
original data definition.
Untyped clients still use the untyped data file.

@Figure-ref{fig:adaptor} illustrates the basic problem that typed adaptors solve.
The issue is that Racket structure types (record type definitions) are
@emph{generative}; each assignment of a type annotation to an untyped structure
creates a new ``black box'' definition.
This means that two syntactically-identical type assignments to
the same structure are incompatible.
Using an adaptor ensures that only one canonical type is generated for each
structure, as illustrated in the right half of @figure-ref{fig:adaptor}.

Strictly speaking, typed adaptor modules are not necessary.
It is possible to modify the design of imports for any given configuration so
that a single typed module declares and re-exports type annotations for untyped
data.
This necessary redesign, however, often presents a non-trivial challenge and
made it impossible for us to synthesize the @math{2^n} gradually-typed variations from
a fully-untyped and fully-typed version of each benchmark.

The layer of indirection provided by adaptors solved this issue and overall
reduced the number of type annotations needed at boundaries because all typed
clients could reference a single point of control.@note{In our experimental
framework, typed adaptors are available to all configurations as library files.}
Therefore we expect typed adaptor modules to be of independent use to
practictioners.


@section{Program Descriptions}

@; TODO a gentler intro
Here we briefly describe each benchmark and note the dependencies
and adaptor modules required to run it.
Unless otherwise noted, the benchmarks rely only on core Racket libraries and
use no adaptor modules.

@parag{Sieve}
This program finds prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and is our
smallest benchmark. It consists of two modules: a tiny streams library and a
script implementing the Sieve using streams.

@parag{Morse code}
The @tt{morse-code} script was adapted from a morse code training program@note{@url["https://github.com/jbclements/morse-code-trainer"]}.
The original program would play a morse code audio clip, read the keyboard for
user input, and score the input based on its Levenshtein distance from the
correct answer. Our benchmark tests generating morse code strings and running the
Levenshtein algorithm on a list of frequently-used English words.

@parag{MBTA}
The @tt{mbta} program implements a server that asynchronously responds to
path queries about a model of Boston's public transit system.
The model is implemented using a third-party, untyped graph library.
This introduces a typed-untyped boundary even in the ``completely typed'' case.

@parag{ZO Traversal}
The @tt{zo-traversal} script explores Racket bytecode structures (parsed from @tt{.zo} bytecode files)
and counts the frequency of AST nodes.
The script operates on the Racket compiler's untyped zo data structures.
Since these data structures are not natively supported in Typed Racket, even the
completely typed program incurs some dynamic overhead.

@parag{Suffixtree}
The @tt{suffixtree} library implements a longest-common-substring algorithm
using Ukkonen's suffix tree algorithm. While the library has
minimal external dependencies, we need to add one adaptor module for the
algorithm's internal data structures.

@parag{L-NM}
While writing this paper, we developed a small collection of scripts to analyze and present our experimental results.
These scripts are included as the @tt{lnm} benchmark.
Most of this benchmark's running time is spent generating figures using Typed Racket's @tt{plot} library, so the @emph{untyped} version of this progam is noticably less performant on large datasets.
Additionally this benchmark relies on an untyped image rendering library and uses two adaptor modules.

@parag{K-CFA}
The @tt{kcfa} program is a simple implementation of control flow analysis for a
lambda calculus.
The language definitions and analysis are spread across seven modules, four of
which require adaptors because they introduce new datatypes.

@parag{Snake}
This program is based on a contract verification benchmark@note{@url["https://github.com/philnguyen/soft-contract"]}
by Nguyên @|etal|@~cite[nthvh-icfp-2014].
It implements a game where a growing and moving snake tries to eat apples while avoiding walls and its own tail.
Our benchmark, like Nguyên's, runs a pre-recorded history of moves altering the game state and does not display a GUI.
We use one adaptor module to represent the game data types, but otherwise the program is self-contained.

@parag{Synth}
The @tt{synth} benchmark@note{@url["https://github.com/stamourv/synth"]}
is a sound synthesis example from St-Amour @|etal|'s work on
feature-specific profiling@~cite[saf-cc-2015].
The program consists of nine modules, half of which are from Typed Racket's array library.
In order to run these library modules in all typed-untyped variations we created an adaptor module
for the underlying array data structure.

@parag{Tetris}
This program is taken from the same benchmark suite as @tt{snake}@~cite[nthvh-icfp-2014]
and implements the eponymous game.
Like @tt{snake}, the benchmark runs a pre-recorded set of moves. Using it here requires
one adaptor module.

@parag{Gregor}
This benchmark contains thirteen modules and stress-tests a date and time library.
The original library uses a
library for ad-hoc polymorphism that is not supported by Typed Racket. We
get around this limitation by monomorphizing the code and removing @tt{gregor}'s
string parsing component.
The benchmark uses two adaptor modules and relies on a small, untyped library for
acquiring data on local times.

@parag{Quad}
The @tt{quad} project is an experimental typesetting library.
It depends on an external constraint satisfaction solver
library (to divide lines of text across multiple columns) and uses two adaptor modules.
