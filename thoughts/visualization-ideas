Ideas for visualizations

Tony
  - PCA, reduce dimensions in the data?
  - Hill-climbing in the lattice

Vincent
  - Plot paths, scatterplot
      x-axis: mean slowdown along path
      y-axis: max slowdown along path
  - Histogram
      x-axis: number of successors that are good/bad
      y-axis: number of nodes in the lattice with that

Justin
  - Random walk for paths to see path badness

Jesse
  - factor analysis
  - map lattice data into dependency graph for modules
    (weight on dependency edges)
